# modMaker
Quick and dirty mod.yml generator for large OpenKH mod edits

Place the contents of your mod in the `mod` folder.
Run `modMaker.exe`
Copy the contents of the `mod` folder to OpenKH
Edit `OUTPUTmod.yml` to add `title` `description` `originalauthor` and `game` fields
Rename `OUTPUTmod.yml` to `mod.yml`

Do not use this with anything that requires any amount of finesse, like KH2 `msg/jp/*.bar` files. Those are better served with a `binarc` edit.
This is a blunt object tool for a blunt object operation.
